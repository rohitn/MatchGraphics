# MatchGraphics

This is a Mathematica package to match the size and `ImagePadding` of rows, columns or grids of `Graphics` expressions. See the included notebook for usage examples.

This package depends on [Carl Woll's GraphicsInformation package](https://github.com/carlwoll/GraphicsInformation/), which must be installed first.
